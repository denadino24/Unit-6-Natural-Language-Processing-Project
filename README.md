# Unit-6-Natural-Language-Processing-Project
## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP) is used in many apps and devices to interact with users and make meaning of text to determine how to respond, find information, or to create new text. Your goal is to use natural language processing techniques to identify structure, patterns, and meaning in a text to have conversations with a user, execute commands, perform manipulations on the text, or generate new text.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, ArrayLists, the String class, and algorithms to create a program that uses natural language processing techniques:

- **Create at least two ArrayLists** – Create at least two ArrayLists to store the data used in your program, such as data from text files or entered by the user.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and conditionals to find or manipulate elements in an ArrayList or String object.
- **Use methods in the String classs** - Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to divide text into sentences or phrases.
- **Use at least one natural language processing technique** – Use a natural language processing technique to process, analyze, and/or generate text.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description
In this program, the goal is to collect a list of words from the boring.txt file and change it to the advanced.txt file word. For example, if the user inputs "I am feeling sad", the code will change it to output "I am feeling devastated", changing the boring/ basic word into a more advanced word. 

## NLP Techniques
In this natural language processing program, many methods were implemented. For example, we implemented the enhanceVocabulary method which basically checks to see if the word that the user inputted is found in the boring.txt file, if it is then it returns true if else then it returns false. We also implemented other methods such as the isPrimitiveFeeling method which checks the location or index of the word and changes the boring word into a more advanced word. Another method that was implemented was the separateWords method which combined all of the methods and changed the boring word as well into an advanced word.
